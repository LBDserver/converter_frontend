# Online open converter tool for IFC files - frontend interface

## Before installation
You need:
- Java version 8+
- a running version of the back-end to this code: https://github.com/LBDserver/converter_backend/

## Installation and getting started
Open console and run:
- `npm install`
- `npm run start`

## What can this web-app do
After starting the server, a local web application (React) starts that allows converting IFC to a number of other data formats:

## Extend the app
Care to extend the application so it can also output other formats, this is easily possible with a small number of code edits as long as you have an executable available of the conversion process.
